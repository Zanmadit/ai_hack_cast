                "Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 1 Welcome to the eighth edition of the AI Index report. The 2025 Index is our most comprehensive to date and arrives at an important moment, as AI\u2019s influence across society, the economy, and global governance continues to intensify. New in this year\u2019s report are in-depth analyses of the evolving landscape of AI hardware, novel estimates of inference costs, and new analyses of AI publication and patenting trends. We also introduce fresh data on corporate adoption of responsible AI practices, along with expanded coverage of AI\u2019s growing role in science and medicine. Since its founding in 2017 as an offshoot of the One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence, the AI Index has been committed to equipping policymakers, journalists, executives, researchers, and the public with accurate, rigorously validated, and globally sourced data. Our mission has always been to help these stakeholders make better-informed decisions about the development and deployment of AI. In a world where AI is discussed everywhere\u2014from boardrooms to kitchen tables\u2014this mission has never been more essential. The AI Index continues to lead in tracking and interpreting the most critical trends shaping the field\u2014from the shifting geopolitical landscape and the rapid evolution of underlying technologies, to AI\u2019s expanding role in business, policymaking, and public life. Longitudinal tracking remains at the heart of our mission. In a domain advancing at breakneck speed, the Index provides essential context\u2014helping us understand where AI stands today, how it got here, and where it may be headed next. Recognized globally as one of the most authoritative resources on artificial intelligence, the AI Index has been cited in major media outlets such as The New York Times, Bloomberg, and The Guardian; referenced in hundreds of academic papers; and used by policymakers and government agencies around the world. We have briefed companies like Accenture, IBM, Wells Fargo, and Fidelity on the state of AI, and we continue to serve as an independent source of insights for the global AI ecosystem. Introduction to the AI Index Report 2025 Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 2 As AI continues to reshape our lives, the corporate world, and public discourse, the AI Index continues to track its progress\u2014 offering an independent, data-driven perspective on AI\u2019s development, adoption, and impact, across time and geography. What a year 2024 has been for AI. The recognition of AI\u2019s role in advancing humanity\u2019s knowledge is reflected in Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry, and the Turing award for foundational work in reinforcement learning. The once-formidable Turing Test is no longer considered an ambitious goal, having been surpassed by today\u2019s sophisticated systems. Meanwhile, AI adoption has accelerated at an unprecedented rate, as millions of people are now using AI on a regular basis both for their professional work and leisure activities. As high-performing, low-cost, and openly available models proliferate, AI\u2019s accessibility and impact are set to expand even further. After a brief slowdown, corporate investment in AI rebounded. The number of newly funded generative AI startups nearly tripled, and after years of sluggish uptake, business adoption accelerated significantly in 2024. AI has moved from the margins to become a central driver of business value. Governments, too, are ramping up their involvement. Policymakers are no longer just debating AI\u2014they\u2019re investing in it. Several countries launched billion-dollar national AI infrastructure initiatives, including major efforts to expand energy capacity to support AI development. Global coordination is increasing, even as local initiatives take shape. Yet trust remains a major challenge. Fewer people believe AI companies will safeguard their data, and concerns about fairness and bias persist. Misinformation continues to pose risks, particularly in elections and the proliferation of deepfakes. In response, governments are advancing new regulatory frameworks aimed at promoting transparency, accountability, and fairness. Public attitudes are also shifting. While skepticism remains, a global survey in 2024 showed a notable rise in optimism about AI\u2019s potential to deliver broad societal benefits. AI is no longer just a story of what\u2019s possible\u2014it\u2019s a story of what\u2019s happening now and how we are collectively shaping the future of humanity. Explore this year\u2019s AI Index report and see for yourself. Yolanda Gil and Raymond Perrault Co-directors, AI Index Report Message From the Co-directors Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 3 Top Takeaways 1. AI performance on demanding benchmarks continues to improve. In 2023, researchers introduced new benchmarks\u2014MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench\u2014to test the limits of advanced AI systems. Just a year later, performance sharply increased: scores rose by 18.8, 48.9, and 67.3 percentage points on MMMU, GPQA, and SWE-bench, respectively. Beyond benchmarks, AI systems made major strides in generating high-quality video, and in some settings, language model agents even outperformed humans in programming tasks with limited time budgets. 2. AI is increasingly embedded in everyday life. From healthcare to transportation, AI is rapidly moving from the lab to daily life. In 2023, the FDA approved 223 AI-enabled medical devices, up from just six in 2015. On the roads, self-driving cars are no longer experimental: Waymo, one of the largest U.S. operators, provides over 150,000 autonomous rides each week, while Baidu\u2019s affordable Apollo Go robotaxi fleet now serves numerous cities across China. 3. Business is all in on AI, fueling record investment and usage, as research continues to show strong productivity impacts. In 2024, U.S. private AI investment grew to $109.1 billion\u2014nearly 12 times China\u2019s $9.3 billion and 24 times the U.K.\u2019s $4.5 billion. Generative AI saw particularly strong momentum, attracting $33.9 billion globally in private investment\u2014an 18.7% increase from 2023. AI business usage is also accelerating: 78% of organizations reported using AI in 2024, up from 55% the year before. Meanwhile, a growing body of research confirms that AI boosts productivity and, in most cases, helps narrow skill gaps across the workforce. 4. The U.S. still leads in producing top AI models\u2014but China is closing the performance gap. In 2024, U.S.- based institutions produced 40 notable AI models, compared to China\u2019s 15 and Europe\u2019s three. While the U.S. maintains its lead in quantity,",

Meanwhile, a growing body of research confirms that AI boosts productivity and, in most cases, helps narrow skill gaps across the workforce. 4. The U.S. still leads in producing top AI models\u2014but China is closing the performance gap. In 2024, U.S.- based institutions produced 40 notable AI models, compared to China\u2019s 15 and Europe\u2019s three. While the U.S. maintains its lead in quantity, Chinese models have rapidly closed the quality gap: performance differences on major benchmarks such as MMLU and HumanEval shrank from double digits in 2023 to near parity in 2024. China continues to lead in AI publications and patents. Model development is increasingly global, with notable launches from the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. 5. The responsible AI ecosystem evolves\u2014unevenly. AI-related incidents are rising sharply, yet standardized RAI evaluations remain rare among major industrial model developers. However, new benchmarks like HELM Safety, AIR-Bench, and FACTS offer promising tools for assessing factuality and safety. Among companies, a gap persists between recognizing RAI risks and taking meaningful action. In contrast, governments are showing increased urgency: In 2024, global cooperation on AI governance intensified, with organizations including the OECD, EU, U.N., and African Union releasing frameworks focused on transparency, trustworthiness, and other core responsible AI principles. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 4 Top Takeaways (cont\u2019d) 6. Global AI optimism is rising\u2014but deep regional divides remain. In countries like China (83%), Indonesia (80%), and Thailand (77%), strong majorities see AI products and services as more beneficial than harmful. In contrast, optimism remains far lower in places like Canada (40%), the United States (39%), and the Netherlands (36%). Still, sentiment is shifting: Since 2022, optimism has grown significantly in several previously skeptical countries, including Germany (+10%), France (+10%), Canada (+8%), Great Britain (+8%), and the United States (+4%). 7. AI becomes more efficient, affordable, and accessible. Driven by increasingly capable small models, the inference cost for a system performing at the level of GPT-3.5 dropped over 280-fold between November 2022 and October 2024. At the hardware level, costs have declined by 30% annually, while energy efficiency has improved by 40% each year. Open-weight models are closing the gap with closed models, reducing the performance difference from 8% to just 1.7% on some benchmarks in a single year. Together, these trends are rapidly lowering the barriers to advanced AI. 8. Governments are stepping up on AI\u2014with regulation and investment. In 2024, U.S. federal agencies introduced 59 AI-related regulations\u2014more than double the number in 2023\u2014and issued by twice as many agencies. Globally, legislative mentions of AI rose 21.3% across 75 countries since 2023, marking a ninefold increase since 2016. Alongside growing attention, governments are investing at scale: Canada pledged $2.4 billion, China launched a $47.5 billion semiconductor fund, France committed \u20ac109 billion, India pledged $1.25 billion, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Project Transcendence represents a $100 billion initiative. 9. AI and computer science education is expanding\u2014but gaps in access and readiness persist. Two-thirds of countries now offer or plan to offer K\u201312 CS education\u2014twice as many as in 2019\u2014with Africa and Latin America making the most progress. In the U.S., the number of graduates with bachelor\u2019s degrees in computing has increased 22% over the last 10 years. Yet access remains limited in many African countries due to basic infrastructure gaps like electricity. In the U.S., 81% of K\u201312 CS teachers say AI should be part of foundational CS education, but less than half feel equipped to teach it. 10. Industry is racing ahead in AI\u2014but the frontier is tightening. Nearly 90% of notable AI models in 2024 came from industry, up from 60% in 2023, while academia remains the top source of highly cited research. Model scale continues to grow rapidly\u2014training compute doubles every five months, datasets every eight, and power use annually. Yet performance gaps are shrinking: the Elo skill score difference between the top and 10th-ranked models fell from 11.9% to 5.4% in a year, and the top two are now separated by just 0.7%. The frontier is increasingly competitive\u2014and increasingly crowded. Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 5 Top Takeaways (cont\u2019d) 11. AI earns top honors for its impact on science. AI\u2019s growing importance is reflected in major scientific awards: Two Nobel Prizes recognized work that led to deep learning (physics) and to its application to protein folding (chemistry), while the Turing Award honored groundbreaking contributions to reinforcement learning. 12. Complex reasoning remains a challenge. AI models excel at tasks like International Mathematical Olympiad problems but still struggle with complex reasoning benchmarks like PlanBench. They often fail to reliably solve logic tasks even when provably correct solutions exist, limiting their effectiveness in high-stakes settings where precision is critical.
